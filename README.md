### Company Information:


My previous company, Linguapal was a short-video based English learning app. The app serves a purpose of creating a real English learning environment for users, making adapting a second language fun and authentic. In another words, the app shows how English is used in real life situation abroad. Build-in functions of the app allow users to pick up every word and sentence, save them, sort them and learn from them later. Mainly two types of short videos are provided, one for entertainment, another for learning. The former one tend to be free in order to attract traffic. And the later one charges a certain amount of fee to purchase, as they are created and uploaded by content createors. Purchased videos cover variety of learning topic, such as English Phonetic Alphabet,  Travel English, Email Writing Session and so on.

### Aims:

Six months after the app was officially online, we got approximately 50,000 registered users, around 5000 daily active users, and little bit more than 13,000 videos in the database. We were thrilled for the achievements. However, along with the growth of user base, disputations begin to grow as well. At that stage, our main concerns are:

* **Who are really paying for buying our products.** It determines what products should we make and how should we form our promotion strategy. 
*  __How long should the video be?__  Should we limit the time of our video, mainly making it short, in order to fit with the impatience of modern app user? However, it elevates difficult for all of our content makers.


As one of the funding members, in order to find some answers. I got the permission to use and analyze 1.5GB of data regarding app users and videos . And I made some amazing discoveries which would definitely help the management of the company.
